## Text Prediction in R and Python

### Project built for the Coursera Data Science Specialisation, Capstone Project

This project processes a set of input text files (not included here), runs a variety of pre-processing/filtering steps, then imports into a SQLite database.

The data is then pulled in using R, processed again into a probabilistic model - this model is then used by a Shiny app as a text prediction system.
